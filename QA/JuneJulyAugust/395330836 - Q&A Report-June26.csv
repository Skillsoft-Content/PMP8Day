If you are using the Zoom client click the upward facing carrot by that chat icon, click turn off chat previews

From the iPhone mobile app you can mute using these steps
1. Click the chat
2. Click the bell icon in the upper right hand corner
3. Select Mute

If you do not have the option to turn off previews or mute the chat, here are some suggestions to try:

- Open the chat window and push it off to the side and down, just leaving the title bar showing
- Keep that chat open and try not to pay attention to it, the popups will stop
- If you don't want to see the chat and have two monitors, you can pop-out the chat, put it on your second screen, and put another program in front of it
