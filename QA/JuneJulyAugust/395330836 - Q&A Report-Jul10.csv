With that in mind, many organizations develop their own templates for project documentation, which are often tailored to their specific needs and processes. These templates can be standardized across projects to ensure consistency and facilitate efficient documentation creation. If your organization does not keep or provide templates, the documents would need to be created from scratch or you can find sample templates online that may be a good starting point.
